## Installing

Please see the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) instructions which has steps on how to use this mod with Star Trek Fleet Command.

Please note, that whilst Mac support was added in this version, it's supported on an as-is basis due to lack of Mac development environments.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Most keyboard shortcuts can be modified by updated your TOML file. If your
file is empty, see the VARS file which has all the runtime settings that have
been applied. Valid values for any short can be found in [KEYMAPPING.md](KEYMAPPING.md)

NOTE: There are some common changes made to allow both mouse and keyboard to
action items such as:

- set action_queue, action_primary and action_recall_cancel to `SPACE|MOUSE1`
  allowing both right mouse click and spacebar to action attacks on (or
  queuing of) hostiles or cancel a warp.

- set action_recall to `R|MOUSE3` to allow recalling using
  both spacebar and the side mouse button
